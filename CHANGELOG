1.0  @  Tue Jan 10 03:45:41 UTC 2017

* Now works with GHC 7.2.2 - 8.0.1.

* Added Eq, Ord, Show, and Read instances for Event and Status.

* Added example programs powermate-print and powermate-pulse.

* Added documentation.

* An open PowerMate is now represented by the opaque type 'PowerMate'
  instead of 'Handle'.  A new function 'closeDevice' exists to close
  the opaque 'PowerMate' type.

* Fixed a bug where the PowerMate would get confused and start
  dropping button presses if you set the LED.

* Removed extraneous printing to stdout.

* Removed getUSBName and readEventWithSkip; I didn't see the utility
  in these functions.

* readEvent no longer returns a Maybe.  There was no meaning to
  'Nothing' and it just had to be ignored.

* Removed the MPD module.  It wasn't directly related to the PowerMate
  functionality, and the "libmpd" package seems to be an alternative
  which is more complete and better maintained.

0.1  @  Sun Feb 24 16:34:18 UTC 2008

* Initial release.
