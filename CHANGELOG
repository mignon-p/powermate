1.0

* Now works with GHC 7.2.2 - 8.0.1.

* Added Eq, Ord, Show, and Read instances for Event and Status.

* Added example programs powermate-print and powermate-pulse.

* Added documentation.

* An open PowerMate is now represented by the opaque type 'PowerMate'
  instead of 'Handle'.  A new function 'closeDevice' exists to close
  the opaque 'PowerMate' type.

* Fixed a bug where the PowerMate would get confused and start
  dropping button presses if you set the LED.

* Removed extraneous printing to stdout.
